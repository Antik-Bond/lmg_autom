Below are new Behave feature files you can add under features/ for Playwright-driven BDD coverage of login, registration, forgot password, and a few related auth flows (logout and session persistence). They use generic, reusable step phrases so you can back them with your Playwright step implementations.
 
Notes and guidance:
- Replace placeholder credentials and emails with your environment’s test accounts. For the registration scenario, prefer generating a unique email per run (e.g., prefix+timestamp) in your step implementation.
- The step phrases are intentionally generic, e.g., I fill "Email" with "...", I click the button "...", I should be redirected to a page with URL containing "..." so they can be backed by Playwright’s locator strategies in your step definitions.
- The accessibility of labels like “Email”, “Password”, button “Sign In”, etc., should match what the app renders. If they differ, adjust the strings to match visible labels or implement flexible matching in steps (e.g., support data-testids).
- The OR expectations (e.g., containing "/verify" or "/dashboard") are to reduce flakiness across environments. If your flows are deterministic, you can simplify assertions to a single expected URL or message.
- Reuse Background steps to reduce repetition; add additional Background steps for cookies/CSRF handling if needed in your environment.
- Tag filters: @smoke marks a minimal path you can run on each build; @auth groups all auth-related scenarios.

If you want, I can also add Playwright-backed Behave step definitions to support these steps (navigation, form fill, clicks, assertions, context restart, etc.).
